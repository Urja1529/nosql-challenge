# Eat Safe, Love Magazine: Food Hygiene Ratings Evaluation
### Introduction
Welcome to the Eat Safe, Love Magazine Food Hygiene Ratings Evaluation project! As contracted data analysts, we have been tasked with evaluating the food hygiene ratings data provided by the UK Food Standards Agency. Our objective is to assist the magazine's journalists and food critics in identifying establishments across the United Kingdom that warrant attention in their future articles.
### Project Overview
The UK Food Standards Agency conducts regular evaluations of various establishments, including restaurants, cafes, pubs, and other food-related businesses. These evaluations result in food hygiene ratings that reflect the level of compliance with food safety standards and regulations. The ratings range from 0 to 5, with 5 indicating excellent hygiene practices and 0 representing urgent improvement required.

### Data Analysis
Our data analysis will revolve around the following key steps:

- Data Collection: We have obtained the latest food hygiene ratings data from the UK Food Standards Agency's official records. This dataset contains information on establishments from all regions of the UK.
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: We will meticulously clean and preprocess the data to ensure its accuracy and reliability. This step involves handling missing or erroneous entries, standardizing formats, and removing any irrelevant information.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Through EDA, we will gain insights into the distribution of food hygiene ratings across different types of establishments and regions. This analysis will help us identify any trends or patterns that may be of interest to Eat Safe, Love Magazine.
- Identifying Promising Establishments: Leveraging the EDA results, we will focus on identifying establishments that stand out due to their exceptionally high or low food hygiene ratings. These establishments could be potential candidates for featured articles or reviews.
- Regional Hotspots: By analyzing ratings by region, we can pinpoint areas with clusters of highly-rated establishments. This will allow Eat Safe, Love Magazine to focus on regions that have made strides in food safety and hygiene.
  
### Deliverables
As part of this project, we will provide Eat Safe, Love Magazine with the following deliverables:

- Food Hygiene Ratings Report: This report will present a comprehensive analysis of the food hygiene ratings data, highlighting key trends, interesting insights, and notable establishments.
- Top-Rated Establishments List: We will compile a list of the highest-rated establishments across different categories, showcasing the cream of the crop in terms of food hygiene.
- Regional Hotspots Analysis: A breakdown of regions with the highest concentration of top-rated establishments, enabling the magazine to target areas with exceptional food safety practices.
